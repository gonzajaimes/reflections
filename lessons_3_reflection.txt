When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I like to share work with others or with different computers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might not want those changes in my local repo.  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are clones within github. Used for copying other githup repos.
clones are copies of repos to work on our local. 
branches are variations of the main project based on a commit and used to create new versions of the project without affecting the master.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can fetch any changes on the remote and merge them with my changes on the master
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By using a set of folders to keep track of versions and changes. 
it would be easier to work with Git
